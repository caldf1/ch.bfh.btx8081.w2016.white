Given the Personal Insulin Pump (PIP) description in the CS2 introduction, try to identify the most common uses cases looking at the PIP system from a user’s perspective.

1.	Start by identifying the potential users of the system and try to elaborate the common use cases for each user type.

Potential Users:
- Patient mit Diabetes mellitus
- Arzt
- Betreuer (Eltern, Pfleger, Vormund, Spitex etc.)

Common use cases:
Siehe use case diagram.


2.	Draw a use case diagram, which shows the involved users and their use cases and indicate the system boundary of what the PIP is actually doing.
Siehe use case diagram.

3.	Investigate if there are dependencies (i.e. include, extend relationships) between the uses cases in the diagram.
Siehe use case diagram.

4.	Take one or two use cases and write a detailed use case scenario for these use cases, including exceptions and/or error conditions.
